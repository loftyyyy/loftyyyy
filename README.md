**Tools:**  Git, IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, Vim, Matlab


## Projects


* **Project Name:** [Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe with Minimax Algorithm](https://github.com/loftyyyy/TicTacSwing)
    ### Description
  This project brings the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe to life with an unbeatable AI opponent. Powered by the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, the AI strategically analyzes every possible move to ensure optimal gameplay. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned Tic-Tac-Toe enthusiast, you'll never win against this AI! The intuitive graphical interface, built using Java Swing, makes it easy to challenge the AI and track your (losing) streak.
  
    ### Technologies Used
    * Java
    * Java Swing
    * Minimax Algorithm
    * Alpha-Beta Pruning
      
* **Project Name:** [MIDI-Machine]([https://github.com/loftyyyy/TicTacSwing](https://github.com/loftyyyy/MIDI-Machine/)
    ### Description
  This project empowers you to create your own beats and rhythms using a simple yet versatile interface. Select from various drum and percussion sounds, then click boxes on the grid to build your custom patterns. Control the tempo, play your masterpiece in real-time, and even save or load your creations to pick up where you left off. Let your inner musician loose!
  
    ### Technologies Used
    * Java: The programming language at the heart of this project, providing the foundation for audio manipulation and user interface design.
    * Java MIDI API (javax.sound.midi): The core technology enabling interaction with MIDI devices and sequences, allowing you to generate and control musical notes and events.
    * Java Swing: A GUI toolkit used to craft the interactive interface, featuring checkboxes for note selection, buttons for control, and labels for instrument names.
    * Serialization (java.io.Serializable): This feature is used to save and load your rhythmic patterns, ensuring your musical ideas are never lost.
      
## Learning Journey

* Actively working through Java tutorials and courses.
* Exploring Spring Boot documentation and building sample projects.
* Looking for ways to apply my knowledge to real-world scenarios.
